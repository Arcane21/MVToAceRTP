# MVToAceRTP
A conversion of the RPG Maker MV RTP for Vx Ace use, for users of both game engines.

This is a conversion of the RPG Maker MV RTP graphics for use in RPG Maker VX Ace. It only contains stock RTP imagery from MV, meaning you must have a license to use RPG Maker MV, copyright to Kadokawa.

And since it has been converted to use for Vx Ace, you must have license to use VX Ace, copyright to Enterbrain.

It is formatted so it can be used as drop in replacement for the VX Ace RTP (where files would overwrite), and so far only contain files that required conversion to work properly. I will format the rest of the RTP (like the sideview battlers/characters) if there is a need for those or any other RTP files. If you intend to use these files alongside the VX Ace RTP, you will need to rename them (and other text files that go along with some of the tilesheets)

Special credit goes to Archeia, who suggested the licensing terms and legal information I should include.

There is no need to credit me, this was a very simple conversion via GIMP, with some minor sharpening added to maintain picture clarity, just please abide by the above copyright restricts and let me know if if any further assistance is required or any thoughts you have on this at:
